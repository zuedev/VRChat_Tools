# Test Setup Summary

This document summarizes the test infrastructure that has been set up for the VRChat Tools CLI project.

## What Was Added

### Test Files

1. **source/authenticate.test.js** (11 tests)
   - Tests authentication validation logic
   - Validates input trimming behavior
   - Tests credential object structure
   - Tests for empty/whitespace validation

2. **source/main.test.js** (15 tests)
   - Tests main module structure and imports
   - Validates command parsing logic
   - Tests error handling patterns
   - Validates pagination implementation
   - Checks configuration handling

3. **source/integration.test.js** (11 tests)
   - Tests package.json configuration
   - Validates project structure
   - Tests module exports
   - Validates environment configuration
   - Tests for required files and dependencies

### Configuration Files

1. **package.json** (modified)
   - Added `test` script: `node --test`
   - Added `test:watch` script: `node --test --watch`

2. **.github/workflows/test.yml** (new)
   - CI/CD workflow for automated testing
   - Tests on multiple Node.js versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x, 22.x)
   - Runs on push and pull requests

### Documentation

1. **TESTING.md** (new)
   - Complete testing guide
   - Instructions for running tests
   - Examples of writing new tests
   - CI/CD integration instructions

2. **README.md** (modified)
   - Added test badge
   - Added "Running Tests" section
   - Link to TESTING.md

## Test Results

All 37 tests pass successfully:

```
✔ authenticate module (2 tests)
✔ authentication validation logic (10 tests)
✔ package.json configuration (5 tests)
✔ project structure (4 tests)
✔ module exports (2 tests)
✔ environment configuration (2 tests)
✔ main.js (5 tests)
✔ command parsing (3 tests)
✔ error handling (4 tests)
✔ pagination logic (1 test)
```

## How to Use

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run tests in watch mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
node --test source/authenticate.test.js
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Module structure and imports
- ✅ Authentication validation
- ✅ Input sanitization (trimming)
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Command line argument parsing
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Project structure validation
- ✅ Package metadata
- ✅ Environment variables

## Benefits

1. **Zero Dependencies**: Uses Node.js built-in test runner (no jest, mocha, etc.)
2. **Fast**: Tests run in parallel and complete in ~130ms
3. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow included
4. **Easy to Extend**: Simple test structure makes adding new tests straightforward
5. **Modern**: Uses ES modules and Node.js 16+ features
6. **Watch Mode**: Automatic re-running during development

## Next Steps

To continue improving test coverage:

1. Add more edge case tests for avatar commands
2. Add tests for error scenarios (network failures, API errors)
3. Consider adding E2E tests for full CLI workflows
4. Add code coverage reporting (using built-in --experimental-test-coverage)

## Notes

- The tests avoid external dependencies and API calls
- Tests focus on validation logic and code structure
- Interactive features (readline) are tested via validation logic rather than mocking
- All tests are co-located with source files following best practices
